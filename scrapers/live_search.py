"""
On-demand live search — re-scrapes every enabled source right now, filtered
by a one-off search phrase instead of config.yaml's standing keyword list.
Unlike the dashboard's regular search box (which only searches listings
already collected by a past scheduled run), this hits the real sites live,
so it can surface something posted minutes ago that hasn't been through a
scheduled run yet.

Slow by nature (several sources use a full headless-browser fetch) — callers
should run this in a background thread and poll `on_progress` state rather
than block a request on it.
