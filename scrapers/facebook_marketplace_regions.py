"""
The 8 US Facebook Marketplace regions and their location IDs.

Facebook's own Marketplace search is location-anchored (facebook.com/
marketplace/{location_id}/...), and the radius around that location is
whatever the user has configured inside Marketplace itself (Facebook
remembers it per-account, not something addable to the URL). These 8
location IDs were discovered by inspecting SearchTempest's own public
"open all regions" links — a well-established, unofficial technique long
used by other classifieds-search tools, since Facebook doesn't publish or
support a location-ID API for outside use.

If Facebook ever retires one of these IDs, re-discover it the same way:
do any search on searchtempest.com, open the "Facebook Marketplace" panel,
and inspect the region links' hrefs.
